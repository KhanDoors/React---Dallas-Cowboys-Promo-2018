          There is excitement for this team, but the offense is going to have to
          be healthy on the offensive line to stay a top five unit in the
          league, and the defense will need to step up in big-time moments when
          the season is on the line as they failed at that in the past. Success
          for the Cowboys will come down to just how healthy the offensive line
          stays and if the depth of the front five can fill in until the
          original Big 5 are all healthy and playing at the same time. Keep and
          eye on Connor Williams at guard and La’el Collins at guard, plus Joe
          Looney at center still gives this team a solid chance to bring a spark
          to the franchise this season. This defense has a chance to be the best
          Cowboys defense in quite some time as draft choices are starting to
          hit their stride and can not only improve the defensive unit, but
          possibly help the offense figure out some parts of their game with how
          they perform each week. It is okay to be excited for this defense –
          they could surprise many and possibly become game changers in the NFC
          East. Taking everything said into account, this still could be a
          successful season for the Cowboys. A double-digit win finish will get
          them into the playoffs, and this team has the talent to be a playoff
          team.
