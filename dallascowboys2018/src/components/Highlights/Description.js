          Expecting to see the Cowboys open the season against the rival New
          York Giants? Well, you weren't alone. Instead, they'll look to head
          east to Charlotte and take on the Carolina Panthers, a playoff team
          that consistently seems one step away from taking home the franchise's
          first Lombardi trophy. Cam Newton is one of the best quarterbacks in
          the NFL when he's firing on all cylinders, and arguably one of the
          worst when he's off his game. Making him more apt to the former is
          second-year star Christian McCaffrey, a dynamo who can hit a home run
          with every touch of the ball, and perennial All-Pro linebacker Luke
          Kuechly is healthy and ready to again anchor a defense that still
          boasts a time-defying Julius Peppers. The Cowboys will have their
          hands full in this contest, but Newton can be forced into poor throws
          if pressure is applied while being able to contain him in the pocket.
          DeMarcus Lawrence can most certainly get the job done. The Cowboys
          will drop the hammer that is Ezekiel Elliott, and win this one big for
          Syyad and the boys over at Lake Mary.
